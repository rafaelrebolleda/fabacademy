    <h1>W5: 3D Scanning + Printing</h1>
    <h2>3D Scannning</h2>
    <p>3D scanning seems like a pretty straightforward task, but like so many other things, it requires a thoughtful apporach. What you think is the whole task is actually just tge beginnnig.</p>
    <p>This is the device we have at the lab, an Artec 3D:</p><img src="scan_1.jpg" alt=""><img src="scan_2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>White surfaces work better than darker ones, so we tried something that we thought might be manageable, like a small remote clicker on an improvised stand.</p><img src="clicker.jpg" alt="">
    <p>We give it a go by scanning around the object. The software on the computer informs what the best scanning distance, but the white table doesn't help, plus it's hard to scan the back.</p>
    <video src="scanvid.mp4" type="video/mp4" autoplay controls muted loop></video>
    <p>The results are not very good, and we're not comfortable with the set-up, so we try something different. In the lab there's a bike helmet laying around, so we give that a try. To scan all sides, we improvise a rotating stand with a stool.</p><img src="scan_3.jpg" alt="">
    <p>In this case, we keep the scanner mostly in the same positions, making sure we're keeping the recommended distance and angle by the sofrware.</p><img src="scan_6.jpg" alt=""><img src="scan_7.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The scanning process is fairly fast, so now we have to clean the mess[h]. The sfotware makes it fairly easy with a range of 2D and 3D selection tools.</p><img src="scan_8.jpg" alt=""><img src="scan_9.jpg" alt=""><img src="scan_10.jpg" alt="">
    <p>From there on, it's a reasonable wizard-style process with just a few parameters to configure.</p><img src="scan_11.jpg" alt=""><img src="scan_12.jpg" alt=""><img src="scan_13.jpg" alt=""><img src="scan_14.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Here's the "final" product. Of course, in a real case scenario, we would probably go back to tweak the cleaning and the closing of surfaces.</p><img src="scan_15.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>3D Printing: Design Rules</h2>
    <p>I tried three different printers to compare some of the design rules for this assignment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="https://www.snapmaker.com/product">Snap-Maker</a> that I had bought a couple of years ago to mess around and that was actually sitting in a box :(</li>
      <li>A <a href="https://zortrax.com/3d-printers/m200-plus/">Zortrax M200</a></li>
      <li>A <a href="https://www.tiertime.com/up-plus-2/">Tiertime UP Plus 2</a>. "Timeless reliability"... oh, well :D</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Wall Thickness</h3>
    <p>Here's the Snap Maker</p><img src="sm_thickness.jpg" alt="">
    <p>And here's the Zortrax</p><img src="z_thickness.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Clearance</h3>
    <p>In this case, the Snap Maker failed me... or maybe I failed her with not enough glue, heating and rafting. Everything was going smoothly but sadly the piece dettached halfway through.</p>
    <video src="sm_clearance.mp4" type="video/mp4" autoplay controles muted loop></video>
    <p>The Zortrax did complete the job had also had better defaults for support, although the quality overall is a bit rough</p><img src="z_clearance_1.jpg" alt=""><img src="z_clearance_2.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Angle</h3><img src="sm_angle_1.jpg" alt=""><img src="sm_angle_2.jpg" alt=""><img src="z_angle.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Bridging</h3>
    <p>This is the only test we could ever complete on the Tiertime UP. Very, very unreliable machines... the lab has quite a few of them and there was always some issue. most tests just didn't run, the extruder wouldn't work, it would randomly stop half-way through, etc. </p>
    <p>A big learning is that 3D printing amplifies frustration, as everything takes a lot of time and errors amount to a lot of wasted time.</p><img src="up_bridging.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Overhang</h3>
    <p>In this example we can see again a different approach to supports between the Snap Maker and the Zortrax</p><img src="sm_overhang.jpg" alt=""><img src="z_overhang.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Surface finish</h3>
    <p>After the previous experience, I though I would do all the remaining tests in the same print, but that wasn't a good idea:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It takes WAY more time printing than doing them individually</li>
      <li>If it fails, all of them fail</li>
    </ul><img src="sm_fail1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The other learning after stopping the process if that you can also do flexible strips in 3D priniting :)</p><img src="sm_fail2.jpg" alt=""><img src="sm_fail3.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Anyway, the print went fine. I'm again surprised at the quality and speed of the Snap Maker when compared to the other printers I've tried for this excercise.</p><img src="sm_finish_1.jpg" alt=""><img src="sm_finish_2.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Infill</h3>
    <p>In this case I paused the printing to take a picture, which I hadn't done previously</p><img src="sm_infill.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Dimensions</h3>
    <p>The outside is pretty much spot on:</p><img src="sm_dimensions_1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>On the inside, however, we need account for the difference.</p><img src="sm_dimensions_2.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Anisotropy</h3><img src="sm_anisotropy.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Thoughts on the different printers</h3>
    <p>I have to say I came surprisingly happy with my purchase of the Snap Maker. It has proven to almost always produce better results, faster and more reliably than the other ones that I tried for the assignment. I thought it'd be more of a hobbyist toy, but now I can see I can use it for more things, not to mention the eye-opening CNC carving of PCBs that I can also do with it!</p>
    <h2>3D Printing: Model</h2>
    <p>The idea is to do a a very simple proof od concept with two solids in a disposition that would be very complicated to achieve by substractive means. In this case, a sphere within a cube.</p><img src="cubesphere_0.jpg" alt=""><img src="cubesphere_1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Fusion likes to take its sweet little time to cloud-export to STL a simple file like this... like MINUTES!</p><img src="export.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The first try is optimistic, with no supports. Perhaps unsurprisingly, It doesn't work:</p>
    <video src="nosupport.mp4" type="video/mp4" autoplay controles muted loop></video>
    <p>Next try with light support for the sphere and the cube. I'm doubtful about the removal of all of it...</p><img src="sm_cubesphere.jpg" alt="">
    <p>It turned out quite alright!</p><img src="sm_cubesphere_finished.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Final Project Designs</h2>
    <h3>Fixture</h3>
    <p>In order to link the servo motor and gears to the spinning ring, I needed to create a piece that would both connect and hold them together. Here's the original sketch:</p><img src="../DEV/slipring_1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I worked with <a href="shapr3d.com">Shapr3D</a> on the iPad to create this piece. The first design was a bit too big and simple:</p><img src="../W2/fixture.jpg" alt="">
    <video src="fixture_printing.mp4" autoplay controls loop muted></video>
    <p>After a couple iterations, I came up with this design:</p>
    <video src="../W2/fixture.mp4" autoplay controls loop muted></video>
    <p>Here's each section's purpose:</p><img src="fixture_annotations.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Here's one of many ABS 3D prints. </p><img src="fixture_printed.jpg" alt="">
