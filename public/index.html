    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there and thanks for dropping by :)</p>

      <li>MBA in Digital Transformation + Masters in Strategic Knowledge Management</li>
      <li>BA in Multimedia</li>
      <li>20+ years of experience in Innovation, designing digital products and services with international reac</li>
      <li>Startups, corporations, agencies and consultin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I've already done a few projects in what I would call <i>crafmanship prototyping</i>. I guess it's just a fancy way of saying hacking a few ideas together with whichever means available and a good deal of good old sweat.</p>
    <p>Here's the modification and installation of one pick-up per string:</p><img src="images/gklp.jpg" alt="">
    <p>In this case, I installed an arduino-based MIDI controller:</p><img src="images/strat.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This is a full guitar hand-made from scratch:</p><img src="images/esish.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>I approach Fab Academy as a means to <b>prototype as many ideas as I can around around the theme presented above.</b>, as well as aqcuiring new skills to flesh them out beyond the notebook.</p>
    <p>To that extent, I foresee the final project taking shape as we advance through the program and I see how the learnings can be applied to my interests, by then doing self-contained micro-projects for each assignment. It's a somewhat similar approach to the one described in picture below (don't know who to credit it to!)</p><img src="images/process.png" alt="">
    <p>Similar to the process described above, there's an underlying theme that connects all products, but these are actually all different, not necessarily part of a bigger project.</p>
    <h1>Final project ideas</h1>
    <p>I have a number of ideas around the <b>creation and manipulation of music: instruments, effects (re-parametrizers, as a good friend liked to call them :), accesories and devices in general that enable new ways of approaching music composition and performance.</b></p>
    <p>In particular, I'm interested in moving forward the <b>expresiveness</b> available to the performer in now-classic instruments, like electric guitars, which haven't really changed much since their original concept, as well as <b>bringing HCD and HCI approaches</b> to the design and development of <b>modern computational musical devices</b>.</p></p><p>Moreover, I'm particularly interested in moving my skills <b>from one-off, handmade products to semi-industrial, machine-made products</b>. I find that some of my ideas require a precision that is hard to achieve and/or replicate by hand</p><img src="images/pedalboard.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/squares.jpg" alt=""><img src="images/switcher.jpg" alt="">
