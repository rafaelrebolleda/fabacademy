        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there and thanks for dropping by :)</p>
        <p>Really quick (for now):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently: Indepdent consultant + University professor in User Experience </li>
            <li>MBA / Digital Transformation + Masters in Strategic Knowledge Management </li>
            <li>20+ years of experience in Innovation, designing digital products and services with international reach</li>
            <li>Startups, corporations, consultancy</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1>Final project ideas</h1>
        <p>I have a number of ideas around the <b>creation and manipulation of music: instruments, effects (re-parametrizers, as a good friend liked to call them :), accesories and devices in general that enable new ways of approaching music composition and performance.</b></p>
        <p>In particular, I'm interested in moving forward the <b>expresiveness</b> available to the performer in now-classic instruments, like electric guitars, which haven't really changed much since their original concept, as well as <b>bringing HCD and HCI approaches</b> to the design and development of <b>modern computational musical devices</b>.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I'm particularly interested in moving my skills <b>from one-off, handmade products to semi-industrial, machine-made products</b>. I find that some of my ideas require a precision that is hard to achieve and/or replicate by hand</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I've already done a few projects in what I would call <i>crafmanship prototyping</i>. I guess it's just a fancy way of saying hacking a few ideas together with whichever means available and a good deal of good old sweat.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>I approach Fab Academy as a means to <b>prototype as many ideas as I can around around the theme presented above.</b>, as well as aqcuiring new skills to flesh them out beyond the notebook </p> 
        <p>To that extent, I foresee the final project taking shape as we advance through the program and I see how the learnings can be applied to my interests, by then doing self-contained micro-projects for each assignment. It's a somewhat similar approach to the one described in picture below (don't know who to credit it to!) </p>
        <img src="images/process.png" alt="">
        <p>Similar to the process described above, there's an underlying theme that connects all products, but these are all actually different, not necessarily part of a bigger project.</p>
