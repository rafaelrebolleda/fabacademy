        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there and thanks for dropping by :)</p>
        <p>Really quick (for now):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently: Indepdent consultant + University professor in User Experience </li>
            <li>MBA / Digital Transformation + Masters in Strategic Knowledge Management </li>
            <li>20+ years of experience in Innovation, designing digital products and services of international reach</li>
            <li>Startups, corporations, consultancy</li>

        </ul>
    
        <h1>Final project ideas</h1>
        <p>I approach Fab Academy as a means to <b>prootype a number of ideas around the creation and manipulation of music</b>: instruments, effects and accesories that enable new ways of approaching compositions and performance.
        </p>
        <p>To that extent, I foresee the final project taking shape as we advance through the program and I do self-contained micro-projects, rather than building the pieces along the way. It's a somewhat similar approach to the one described in picture below (don't know who to credit it to!) </p>
