    <h1>The <em>new</em> Final Project</h1>
    <p>With the pandemic still ongoing, I've found myself in July still with limited access to the Fab Lab, so in accordance with my mentor, we've decided to take a different approach to how I thought the Fab Academy would unfold. To that extent, we've come up with a new final project that will make the most of the assignments, specially using the machine as part of it.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Light-painting is an art form which consists taking pictures of moving light, capturing the traces as it moves in space.</p>
    <p>I've doing light-painting photogrpah for a while, in a very rudimentary way.</p>
    <p>This is my set up: a dark background in a closet. This is actually the same room and spot from which I've had to connect sometimes throughout the pandemic confinement!</p><img src="_Escenario.jpg" alt="">
    <p>And this are the lights I've used: kids toys and a laser pointer.</p><img src="_Iluminación.jpg" alt="">
    <p>These are just a couple of shots with this set up:</p><img src="Dracarys.jpg" alt=""><img src="Rock.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Other projects</h2>
    <p>I've seen there have been some other projects around light painting in Fab Academy. For example <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabhornafjordur/students/201/week11.html">this one</a> made during Fab Academy 2017 by Ana Cabral, Ola Mirecka and Birkir Thor:</p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/213813915" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Or <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Harvard/machines/index.html">this one</a>, which is somewhat similar:</p>
    <video src="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Harvard/machines/photos/programming/14.mp4" loop autoplay muted></video>
    <p>What I'm thinking of is something different, though.</p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>For this project, I'm looking to create a machine that does something similar to another shot of mine, albeit in a more portable studio with more interesting possibilities.</p><img src="eMotion.jpg" alt="">
    <p>In short, the idea to make <strong>a closed box with moving lights create pseudo-random light-paintings via long exposure shots</strong>.</p><img src="box.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The box will be completely black inside, and has a few small opening for a mobile camera phone to see thorugh. The faces will be covered in velcro to allow for easy attachment.</p>
    <p>Inside, concentric circles with LEDs will spin and their traces will be captured. Both LED behaviour and <em>some aspects</em> of the movement can be programmed and or controlled.</p>
    <p>Each circle could have up to four LEDs, as seen in the cross-section below, although that's probably not necessary to creat interesting effects, and could be a power consumption hurdle.</p><img src="pixels.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The movement behaviour should be something similar to this example:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1JNWnTpmkA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>So, ideally, we would have a step motor at the base, controlling the outer circle's rotation, and the one nested inside would spin freely.</p>
    <h2>Potential Challenges</h2>
    <p>The main challenge seems to be to pass information and power through the spinning axis, both in between circles and down to the main board after the main motor.</p>
    <p>We've got a couple of ideas of how to go about it, based on good old LPs.</p><img src="LP1.jpg" alt=""><img src="LP2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>We've also given some thought on how to manufacture some of these pieces with a combinations of 3D printing, small ball bearings and a few  hacks:</p><img src="rings.jpg" alt="">
    <p>It also seems these devices are <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/775">also available</a> (d'oh), so it might be worth exploring the differences between the approaches.</p><img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/775-01.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Some thought has been given to easier, linear approaches, but the results are different, closer to the examples shown above from previous years:</p><img src="alternative1.jpg" alt=""><img src="alternative2.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Spirals</h2>
    <p>These are the initial high-level thoughts about the project development. I foresee these will change rapidly in time, as it often happens as we learsn and, well, things happen :)</p>

    <h1>Previously, in a pre-pandemic life...</h1>
    <p>(These were my original thoughts about the final project, but in light of the pandemic and associated restrictions, we thought it lacked focus and "tightness". I will have to follow up on this later on :)</p>
    <p>I approach Fab Academy as a means to <b>prototype as many ideas as I can around around the theme presented below.</b>, as well as aqcuiring new skills to flesh them out beyond the notebook.</p>
    <p>To that extent, I foresee the final project taking shape as we advance through the program and I see how the learnings can be applied to my interests, by then doing self-contained micro-projects for each assignment. It's a somewhat similar approach to the one described in picture below (don't know who to credit it to!)</p><img src="process.png" alt="">
    <p>Similar to the process described above, there's an underlying theme that connects all products, but these are actually all different, not necessarily part of a bigger project.</p>
    <h1>Final project ideas</h1>
    <p>I have a number of ideas around the <b>creation and manipulation of music: instruments, effects (re-parametrizers, as a good friend liked to call them :), accesories and devices in general that enable new ways of approaching music composition and performance.</b></p>
    <p>In particular, I'm interested in moving forward the <b>expresiveness</b> available to the performer in now-classic instruments, like electric guitars, which haven't really changed much since their original concept, as well as <b>bringing HCD and HCI approaches</b> to the design and development of <b>modern computational musical devices</b>.</p></p><p>Moreover, I'm particularly interested in moving my skills <b>from one-off, handmade products to semi-industrial, machine-made products</b>. I find that some of my ideas require a precision that is hard to achieve and/or replicate by hand</p><img src="pedalboard.jpg" alt=""><img src="squares.jpg" alt=""><img src="switcher.jpg" alt="">
