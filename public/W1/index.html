    <h1>Final Project</h1>
    <p>I approach Fab Academy as a means to <b>prototype as many ideas as I can around around the theme presented above.</b>, as well as aqcuiring new skills to flesh them out beyond the notebook.</p>
    <p>To that extent, I foresee the final project taking shape as we advance through the program and I see how the learnings can be applied to my interests, by then doing self-contained micro-projects for each assignment. It's a somewhat similar approach to the one described in picture below (don't know who to credit it to!)</p><img src="process.png" alt="">
    <p>Similar to the process described above, there's an underlying theme that connects all products, but these are actually all different, not necessarily part of a bigger project.</p>
    <h1>Final project ideas</h1>
    <p>I have a number of ideas around the <b>creation and manipulation of music: instruments, effects (re-parametrizers, as a good friend liked to call them :), accesories and devices in general that enable new ways of approaching music composition and performance.</b></p>
    <p>In particular, I'm interested in moving forward the <b>expresiveness</b> available to the performer in now-classic instruments, like electric guitars, which haven't really changed much since their original concept, as well as <b>bringing HCD and HCI approaches</b> to the design and development of <b>modern computational musical devices</b>.</p></p><p>Moreover, I'm particularly interested in moving my skills <b>from one-off, handmade products to semi-industrial, machine-made products</b>. I find that some of my ideas require a precision that is hard to achieve and/or replicate by hand</p><img src="pedalboard.jpg" alt=""><img src="squares.jpg" alt=""><img src="switcher.jpg" alt="">
