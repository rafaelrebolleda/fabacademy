    <h1>W15: Molding & Casting</h1>
    <h2>Materials to explore</h2>
    <p>For this assignment I wanted to experiment with concrete and epoxy, as I'm intested in both materials for different reasons: I would like to further play around with concrete in the context of furniture and epoxy could come in handy for my musical devices endeavours.</p>
    <h2>The positive</h2>
    <h3>Designing the piece</h3>
    <p>I devised a quick paperwieight of sorts to try out different shapes, and quickly modeled it on <a href="https://www.shapr3d.com/">Shapr3D</a>:</p><img src="pw_1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>It probably is obvious to the experienced eye, but I learned throughout the assignment that this piece had a number of design flaws that would later impact the development of the negative and positive: some walls are too thin and some cavities are too small. </p>
    <h3>3D Printing</h3>
    <p>This process was a bit long but fairly straight-forward. I put a bit of plaster all around to make the surface smoother:</p><img src="pw_2.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>The negative</h2>
    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <p>Witrh the pandemic still going strong, resource availability was still an issue, so I used the following two-component silicon mostly because I could get my hands on it on time:</p><img src="pw_3.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>The container box</h3>
    <p>I made in AutoCAD a simple box out, which was then laser-cut out of plexiglass and glued with chroloform. In it I'll place the 3D-printed model and later drop the silicon.</p>
    <p>Here's the design:</p><img src="box_1.jpg" alt="">
    <p>And the set up for the laser cutter:</p><img src="box_2.jpg" alt="">
    <video src="box_3.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted></video>
    <p>Now we're ready to create the negative.</p><img src="pw_4.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>The silicon negative</h3>
    <p>This silicon is made out of two components mixed in equal parts, and it cures in a few hours, although I let it rest for a day.</p>
    <video src="pw_5.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted></video>
    <p>I begin to see that this feature will be complicated to replicate with this technique:</p><img src="pw_6.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The next day it's ready to be removed:</p><img src="pw_7.jpg" alt="">
    <video src="pw_8.mp4" autoplay controls loop muted></video><img src="pw_9.jpg" alt="">
    <p>As foreseen, these slots were too thin for this technique. I didn't have time to order more silicon, so I took the learning and moved forward with the process.</p><img src="pw_10.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Casting with concrete</h2>
    <h3>Dropping the material</h3>
    <p>I prep the containter box again to hold the mould in place and shape while the concrete is poured.</p><img src="pw_11.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Then it's about mixing the concrete with a bit of sand and water:</p>
    <video src="pw_12.mp4" autoplay loop muted controls></video>
    <p>And finally applying it to the mould:</p><img src="pw_13.jpg" alt=""><img src="pw_14.jpg" alt="">
    <h3>Removing the material</h3>
    <p>A day later the concrete is dry and ready to be removed:</p><img src="pw_15.jpg" alt=""><img src="pw_16.jpg" alt="">
    <video src="pw_17.mp4" autoplay loop muted controls></video><img src="pw_18.jpg" alt=""><img src="pw_19.jpg" alt="">
