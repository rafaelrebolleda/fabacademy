    h1 Project Development
    p These are the initial high-level thoughts about the project development. I foresee these will change rapidly in time, as it often happens as we learsn and, well, things happen :)

    h2 Spiral 1: Ideation
    ol.checklist 
      li.done Pitch the projects
      li.done Learn from other projects in Fab Academy and elsewhere
      li.done Look for potential challenges
      li.done Check the availability of initial components

    h3 Potential Challenges
    p The main challenge seems to be to pass information and power through the spinning axis, both in between circles and down to the main board after the main motor.

    p We've got a couple of ideas of how to go about it, based on good old LPs.

    p We've also given some thought on how to manufacture some of these pieces with a combinations of 3D printing, small ball bearings and a few  hacks:

    p It also seems these devices are <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/775">also available</a> (d'oh), so it might be worth exploring the differences between the approaches.

    h2 Spiral 2: Proof of concept
    ol.checklist 
      li.done Design and build a FabKit
      li.done Connect the LEDs and the motor
      li.done Design a simple program to test control of all components
    
    p The cornerstone of the project is the FabKit that will control all input and output, so this is where I'll put my initial efforts.
