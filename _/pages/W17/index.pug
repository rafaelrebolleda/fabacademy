    h2 The idea
    p As I mentioned in more detail in the <a href="../W1">Principles and Practices</a>, I've done some long-exposure light painting photography in the past, like the shot below:
    img(src="../W1/eMotion.jpg", alt="")

    p To take these kinds of shots I had tp completely shut down a room to prevent the light from coming in. In a run-of-the-mill family apartment, this is quite a feat.
    p Therefore, the idea of having a small, self-contained and portable studio of sorts to create light paintings seemed like both useful and interesting.
    p In the following drawing, we can see a closed box —no light comes in— with a small hole to take shots with a mobile phone's camera. Inside, there are a number of RGB LEDs that would move, creating the painting with their motion.

    p This assignment ended up becoming my <a href="../FP">final project</a>.

    h2 Designing and building the parts
    h3 Case
    p I though I'd use 10mm plywood, which was easy to source locally, light and manageable, all while being sturdy enough. The pieces are designed to fit tightly together, although I'll be applying glue close to the end of the project.
    img(src="../W7/software_1.jpg", alt="")

    p I though I would add a bit of decoration in relation to the theme of the machine, so I though something like these circled patterns and letters were easy enough to machine yet added a nice touch.

    p Assembling was fairly easy, as the plywood has enough tolerance.
    video(src="../W7/assembling.mp4" autoplay controls muted loop)

    p Here's the case for the machine:
    img(src="../W7/assembled.jpg", alt="")

    p There's quite bit more detail in the <a href="../W7/">Computer Controlled Machining assignment</a>.
    
    h3 Frame
    p As seen in the sketch above, my iniital design for the frame was a circle. Here can see a couople different takes on the base:
    img(src="../DEV/circle_1.jpg", alt="")
    video(src="../DEV/circle_machinning_1.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop) 
    img(src="../DEV/circle_2.jpg", alt="")

    p However, early prototypes showed this approach didn't work well with the focal length of a mobile camera working in the constraints of the case, so I tried other designs:
    img(src="alternatives_1.jpg", alt="")
    img(src="alternatives_2.jpg", alt="")
    img(src="../DEV/shapes.jpg", alt="")

    p Finally I ended up settling on the following one becasue it provided a constant an ideal distance to the top hole in the case, and that would become key when shooting.
    img(src="frame.jpg", alt="")
    video(src="frame.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop) 
    
    p To finish the frame, there needs to be a hole through the base to attach it through it axis of rotation.
    img(src="hole.jpg", alt="")

    p I broke a couple at this point, as it turned out to be to thing to withstand the hole at the base. 
    img(src="crack.jpg", alt="")
    
    p I ended up glueing two frames together to make a 
    img(src="glue.jpg", alt="")

    h3 Fixture
    p At the beginning, my idea was to pass on information and power to the frame through a set of concentric tracks, and fix everything together with just a screw and a nut, with a set of washer in the middle:
    img(src="tracks_0.jpg", alt="")
    img(src="tracks_1.jpg", alt="")

    p I made a whole in the base of the case to host a bearing:
    img(src="tracks_2.jpg", alt="")

    p Inside the bearing I made some extra "cushion" with a couple of plexiglass washers. It took a few tries to get them just tight enough and a good fit for the screw.
    img(src="tracks_3.jpg", alt="")

    p I made the tracks out of PCB stock:
    video(src="../DEV/tracks_1.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop) 
    img(src="tracks_5.jpg", alt="")

    p Giving it a spin manually it seemd like everything was going to go smoothly. I was wrong.
    video(src="../DEV/tracks_2.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop) 

    p I devised a number of ways to get the cables to connect to the tracks:
    img(src="../DEV/tracks_4.jpg", alt="")

    p However, there was too much slack and contact it didn't make for a consistent connection. There would be enoigh drops in continuity to make it unusable.
    video(src="../DEV/tracks_3.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)     
    
    p I tried different designs and approaches, and ended up going on a different path: using a slip ring with a 3D printed fixture to hold everything together:
    img(src="../DEV/slipring_1.jpg", alt="")
    
    p The first design was a both bigger and simpler than other iterations. It features a longer attachment base, according to the first iterations of the frame, and also featured a simple hexagonal ending meant to be inserted in the gears below.
    img(src="../W2/fixture.jpg", alt="")
    video(src="big_fixture.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)     

    p After a few iterations, the framed had moved to a shorter base, and I had also added a small bearing beneath the case's bed, to help with the tilting. This fixture still features the haxgonal fit for the gear, but also an axis that would go into that second bearing.

    img(src="fixture_2.jpg", alt="")
    
    
    p More info about the fixture can be found in the <a href="../W5">3D Printing assignment</a>
    
    h3 Gears
    p At first I planned on using the steo motor I had tried in the <a href="../W11">Output Assignment</a>, but it was pretty obvious the speed was too slow for the use case and I would need to multiply it with a system of gears.
    p I used the online tool <a href="https://geargenerator.com/">Gear Generator</a> to create a couple of gears that would speed up the spinning of the frame. I went witrh the biggest and smallest size I could fit, which resulted in a 1:3 ratio approximately.
    video(src="gears_1.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)
    
    p <a href="https://geargenerator.com/">Gear Generator</a> exports SVGs that can be later imported into AutoCAD, where I cleaned them (there's a lot of text within the gear with its details). I also added a shape used to fix the gears to the motor:
    img(src="../W2/gears.jpg", alt="")

    p sads
    video(src="gears_2.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)
    img(src="gears_3.jpg", alt="")

    p Eventually, after a number of tries and iterations, I ran out of 5mm white plexiglass and had to move to 3mm black plexiglass. I would then "glue" both pieces with chloroform:
    video(src="../W3/gears_1.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)
    img(src="../DEV/gears_3.jpg", alt="")

    p As we can see, I tried to use the biggest and smallest gears I could fit beneath the bed.
    img(src="../W3/gears_3.jpg", alt="")

    p More info about the fixture can be found in the <a href="../W3">Computer Controlled Cutting Assignment</a>

    h3 Motor
    p As mentioned previously, the step motor I had in mind was too slow and didn't seem to have enough torque to move the gears:
    video(src="../W11/output_2.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p However, the step motor I had could barely moved the gears:
    video(src="motor_1.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p I could've tried to make the gears lighter by removing material with a different design, but still I needed more speed. Since speed control was not a requirement for my project, I thought I'd try a servo motor. A quick proof of concept showed promise:
    video(src="motor_2.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p A quick set up with the gears engaged confirmed this was a good solution.
    video(src="../DEV/fixture_3.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)    
    
    h3 Controls
    p I had a pretty good idea from the get go of the interace to control the machine, which was for better or worse constrained by the siwtches and buttons I had at my disposal at the time, since sourcing materials was complicated with covid slowdown.
    img(src="controls_sketch.jpg", alt="")

    p It was fairly straighforward moving from a drawing to a digital design that I could use with the laser cutter. I measured all components and made the digital template.
    img(src="../W2/control_panel.jpg", alt="")

    p Black 3mm plexiglass was what I had at my disposal, so black it was. 
    video(src="../W3/control_panel.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p Wiring was pretty straigh-forward too:
    img(src="../DEV/connections_3.jpg", alt="")

    
    p I don't think it gets any more 80s than this:
    img(src="../W9/control_panel.jpg", alt="")

    
    h2 Operation

    p As seen in the sketch above, very early on I had the idea of two modes of operation: manual and automatic. This would allow for exploration both in interaction and programming.

    p Modes are selected with the main switch in the middle: Manual mode is on the left side and auto mode on the right sode.
    video(src="control_0.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)


    h3 Manual
    p The color for the LEDs in the frame is chosen randomly by clicking this button:
    video(src="control_3.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)
    
    p The color is preserved when switching between manual and auto modes
    video(src="control_4.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p At first I thought I'd use the rotary knob for brightness, but after a number of tries I concluded that it was not an interesting feature, as long-exposure shots couldn't handle more than around 5% brightness anyway.
    video(src="control_2a.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p Therefore I chose to use this control both to switch between the full stripe of LEDs and moving one of them. This proved to be superfun in practice :)
    video(src="control_2b.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p The left-most switch controls whether the frame rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise. The green button is used to start the motor, which will spin as long as it is pressed.
    video(src="control_1.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)
    
    h3 Automatic
    p In automatic mode, there are three programs to choose from:
    video(src="control_5.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p The first program will use the current color and move a single pixel while rotating the frame. It produces shots like this:
    video(src="shot_1.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p The second program is like repeating the first program 10 times with random colors each time. It produces shots likes this:
    video(src="shot_2.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)

    p The third program is similar to program two, but it will randomize the number of "passes" as well as the delay between passes. It produces shots like this:
    video(src="shot_3.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)



    p I added a red button to serve as a "panic mode" that would stop the motor, but in practice I haven't needed to use it.
    video(src="control_6.mp4", autoplay muted controls loop)
