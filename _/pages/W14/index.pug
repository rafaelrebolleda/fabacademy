    h1 W14: Embedded Networking
    p I get to this one assignment very late in the game and still with heavy restrictions on Fab Lab access.
    p I have a Bluetooth module laying around and I will try to connect it to <a href="../W6">my Hello Fab Kit board</a> which I created for the <a href="../FP/">Final Project</a> and to my mobile device to send commands between them.

    h2 The connections

    h3 On the mobile device
    p The bluetood board indicated its availability for pairing with the blinking LED:

    p I'm using the free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/es/app/arduinoblue/id1340487989?l=en">Arduino Blue</a> app to connect to the Bluetooth module.

    p Once both devices are connected to each other, the LED stops blinking.

    h2 Sending messages through the network
    h3 Setting up the code
    p The Hello Fab Kit board will keep listening to the serial port to recognise two different commands:
    ul
        li "1" to turn the LED on
        li "0" to turn the LED off

    h3 Sending the commands
    p Once connected, the mobile app has a basic terminal to send commands:
    img(src="terminal.jpg", alt="")

    p From there, a textfield allows for sending commands from the device to the Hello Fab Kit board:

    h2 Integration
    p It turned out to be much simpler than I expected, but that is also because I learned (and suffered) a lot with serial bus comms on the <a href="../W12">Interface Programming assignment</a>
