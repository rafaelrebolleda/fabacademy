    h1 W1: Principles and Practices

    h2 Setting Up
    p I'm on a rather fresh installation of macOS Catalina, so the first thing to do was to generate an ssh key and set up git.
    h3 Generating an SSH key
    p I just followed <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair">the very simple tutorial on Gitlab's Docs</a>. It will guide through generating the key pair and uploading it to <a href="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/profile/keys">Gitlab's SSH keys section in your profile</a>:
    img(src="keys.jpg", alt="")
    p Now wer're ready to set up git to clone the repo locally and being adding to it and uploading back to Gitlab.

    h3 Setting Up git
    p The git community has <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial">a nice tutorial on their official website</a>.
    p On macOS, typing 'git' on Terminal will prompt you to install the Command Line Developer Tools automatically.

    img(src="git2.jpg", alt="")
    img(src="git3.jpg", alt="")
    
    p Once the key is uploaded and we've got git running locally, we just clone the remote repository from Gitlab:

    h3 Designing and coding the website
    p I wanted to try a template than the default with less clicking to move back and forth between assignments.
    p There are many, many good text editors out there, some free like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or paid like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. I settled on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> because it's free, extensible, multiplatform and well supported.

    p I also wanted to experiment with something different than good old HTML, so I'm going to be trying out <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html">Pug</a> and <a href="https://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a>. Both allow for some utilities and simplified coding. I'll be compiling these to HTML with <a href="https://codekitapp.com/">CodeKit</a>.

    h3 Publishing to FabCloud
    p FabCloud can make your repo into a website if you isntruct them how to build it after every commit pushed.
    p In my case it's just simple HTML so there isn't much to do.
    img(src="yaml.jpg", alt="")

    p Once some code is written it's a matter of comming the changes and pushing back to FabCloud:
    code git add .
    code git commit -m "commit message"
    code git push

    p It may take a bit to update the published website.

    h3 Other tidbits

    p I've also made <a href="Resize-for-Fab.zip">a little Automator workflow</a> to process images for publication, reducing their size and converting them to jpg:
    img(src="automator.jpg", alt="")

    p Here we can see it in action in Finder

    h1 The <em>new</em> Final Project
    p With the pandemic still ongoing, I've found myself in July still with limited access to the Fab Lab, so in accordance with my mentor, we've decided to take a different approach to how I thought the Fab Academy would unfold. To that extent, we've come up with a new final project that will make the most of the assignments, specially using the machine as part of it.

    h2 Background
    p Light-painting is an art form which consists taking pictures of moving light, capturing the traces as it moves in space. I've doing light-painting photogrpah for a while, in a very rudimentary way.
    p This is my set up: a dark background in a closet. This is actually the same room and spot from which I've had to connect sometimes throughout the pandemic confinement!
    img(src="_Escenario.jpg", alt="")

    p And this are the lights I've used: kids toys and a laser pointer.
    img(src="_Iluminaci√≥n.jpg", alt="")
    
    p These are just a couple of shots with this set up:
    img(src="Dracarys.jpg", alt="")
    img(src="Rock.jpg", alt="")

    h2 Other projects
    p I've seen there have been some other projects around light painting in Fab Academy. For example <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabhornafjordur/students/201/week11.html">this one</a> made during Fab Academy 2017 by Ana Cabral, Ola Mirecka and Birkir Thor:

    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/213813915" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    p Or <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Harvard/machines/index.html">this one</a>, which is somewhat similar:

    video(src="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/Harvard/machines/photos/programming/14.mp4" loop autoplay muted)

    p What I'm thinking of is something different, though.

    h2 Project Overview
    p For this project, I'm looking to create a machine that does something similar to another shot of mine, albeit in a more portable studio with more interesting possibilities.
    img(src="eMotion.jpg", alt="")

    p In short, the idea to make <strong>a closed box with moving lights create pseudo-random light-paintings via long exposure shots</strong>.

    img(src="box.jpg", alt="")

    p The box will be completely black inside, and has a few small opening for a mobile camera phone to see thorugh. The faces will be covered in velcro to allow for easy attachment.

    p Inside, concentric circles with LEDs will spin and their traces will be captured. Both LED behaviour and <em>some aspects</em> of the movement can be programmed and or controlled.
    
    p Each circle could have up to four LEDs, as seen in the cross-section below, although that's probably not necessary to creat interesting effects, and could be a power consumption hurdle.
    img(src="pixels.jpg", alt="")

    
    p The movement behaviour should be something similar to this example:

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1JNWnTpmkA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    p So, ideally, we would have a step motor at the base, controlling the outer circle's rotation, and the one nested inside would spin freely.

    p Some thought has been given to easier, linear approaches, but the results are different, closer to the examples shown above from previous years:

    <hr>
    h1 Previously, in a pre-pandemic life...
    p (These were my original thoughts about the final project, but in light of the pandemic and associated restrictions, we thought it lacked focus and "tightness". I will have to follow up on this later on :)

    p I approach Fab Academy as a means to <b>prototype as many ideas as I can around around the theme presented below.</b>, as well as aqcuiring new skills to flesh them out beyond the notebook.
    p To that extent, I foresee the final project taking shape as we advance through the program and I see how the learnings can be applied to my interests, by then doing self-contained micro-projects for each assignment. It's a somewhat similar approach to the one described in picture below (don't know who to credit it to!)
    img(src="process.png", alt="")
    p Similar to the process described above, there's an underlying theme that connects all products, but these are actually all different, not necessarily part of a bigger project.


    h2 Final project ideas
    p I have a number of ideas around the <b>creation and manipulation of music: instruments, effects (re-parametrizers, as a good friend liked to call them :), accesories and devices in general that enable new ways of approaching music composition and performance.</b>
    p In particular, I'm interested in moving forward the <b>expresiveness</b> available to the performer in now-classic instruments, like electric guitars, which haven't really changed much since their original concept, as well as <b>bringing HCD and HCI approaches</b> to the design and development of <b>modern computational musical devices</b>.</p>
    <p>Moreover, I'm particularly interested in moving my skills <b>from one-off, handmade products to semi-industrial, machine-made products</b>. I find that some of my ideas require a precision that is hard to achieve and/or replicate by hand</p>
